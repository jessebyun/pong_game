<h2>Pong Game</h2>


To play Pong, a classic two-player arcade game, each player controls a paddle situated at the left and right side of the screen, with Player 1 using the 'W' key to move their paddle up and the 'S' key to move it down, and Player 2 using the up and down arrow keys for control. The game begins with a ball in the middle of the screen, and the objective is to score points by skillfully maneuvering the ball past your opponent's paddle while preventing it from getting past your own. Scoring occurs when one player successfully accomplishes this feat. As the ball bounces off the walls and paddles, players must exhibit precision and timing to outscore their opponent. Each time the ball bounces off a player's paddle, the ball speed will increase by 10%. Ball speed will reset when player scores a point. Pong is a straightforward yet engaging game. You can compete with a friend challenging your own skills in this timeless and iconic game.
